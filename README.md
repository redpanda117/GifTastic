# GifTastic
GifTastic uses the Giphy API to find and display the images related to anime shows. The page was style with Bootstrap. Jquery was use for the click event. For instance, click on a anime show title will populate 10 gifs. The gifs will be still until it is clicked on. Animated gifs will become still if click on again. Take a look and try it out yourself. Hope you enjoy!
